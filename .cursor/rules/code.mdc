# Cursor rules for code style in dart:

## Code style

- yield other components instead of using static methods
- use package imports
- avoid huge build methods
- keep the sketch of the UI/layout in the build method
- extract details of the UI components into private methods for readability
- extract common components into standalone components in lib/components folder
- order styles, styles should be ordered correctly 

## Good practices

### Include comma at the end of a component to improve readability

```dart
// Bad
span(
    classes: 'some class',
    [text('Some text')])

// Good
span(
    classes: 'some class',
    [text('Some text')],
)
```
